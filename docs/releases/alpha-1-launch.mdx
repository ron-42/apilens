# API Lens Alpha Is Live

This is the first public alpha release of API Lens.

API Lens helps engineering teams monitor API traffic, inspect payload-level behavior, and move from raw request data to action quickly.

## What You Can Do Today

- onboard an app and generate framework-specific setup snippets
- ingest API traffic without manually pre-creating endpoints
- monitor endpoint activity with time filters, search, sort, and pagination
- inspect request logs with payload and response visibility controls
- use passwordless-first authentication with optional password setup after login
- browse live OpenAPI reference in docs from `https://api.apilens.ai/api/v1/openapi.json`

## Platform Foundations in This Alpha

- multi-tenant backend guardrails across app-scoped APIs
- ClickHouse-backed analytics tables and migration flow
- PostgreSQL-backed app, auth, and product state
- deploy-time schema bootstrapping for relational and analytics storage

## Who This Alpha Is For

- teams validating API observability workflows before broader rollout
- developers integrating API Lens from FastAPI, Django/Ninja, and Flask projects
- engineering orgs wanting a clean, minimal UI with practical operational signals

## What Comes Next

- deeper endpoint detail workflows for payload and consumer analysis
- expanded framework setup flows and SDK ergonomics
- iterative UI hardening based on alpha usage patterns

If you are evaluating API Lens for your team, this alpha is the right starting point.
