# Create Your First App

Apps in API Lens isolate keys, environments, and analytics for each API service.

## Step 1: Create app

1. Go to **Apps**
2. Click **Create app**
3. Enter app name
4. Select framework (FastAPI, Flask, Django/Ninja, etc.)
5. Submit

## Step 2: Open setup guide

After creation, API Lens opens a setup page with:

- install command
- middleware/instrumentation snippet
- environment-specific config notes

Use the snippet directly in your app bootstrap file.

## Step 3: Add your API key safely

1. Copy the generated API key once
2. Store it in your secret manager (not in source code)
3. Inject it via environment variable in your service

## Step 4: Deploy and verify

1. Restart/redeploy your API service
2. Send a few real requests
3. Open **Endpoints** in API Lens

You should start seeing endpoint rows automatically.  
No manual endpoint creation is needed.
