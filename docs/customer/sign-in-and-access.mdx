# Sign In and Access

API Lens uses a passwordless-first flow:

- **Sign in with email link** also creates your account automatically if you are new.
- You can set a password later after you are logged in.

## Step 1: Request a magic link

1. Open `https://app.apilens.ai/auth/login`
2. Enter your work email
3. Click **Send magic link**

## Step 2: Verify your email

1. Open the email from API Lens
2. Click **Sign in to API Lens**
3. You will be redirected to your account automatically

## Step 3: Optional password setup

1. Go to account settings
2. Set a password if your team needs email+password sign in

## Step 4: Forgot password flow

1. Click **Forgot password** on login
2. You will receive a secure email link first
3. Open the link and set your new password

## If email link is not working

1. Confirm the URL starts with `https://app.apilens.ai/auth/verify`
2. Check spam folder and corporate email filters
3. Request a fresh link (links expire and are one-time use)
4. Contact support if issue continues
