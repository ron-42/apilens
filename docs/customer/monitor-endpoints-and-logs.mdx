# Monitor Endpoints and Logs

## Step 1: Read endpoint health

Open **Endpoints** and focus on:

- total requests
- requests/min
- error rates by status code
- p95 latency

## Step 2: Use filters

Use right-side filters to narrow data:

- HTTP method
- status code (2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx and specific codes)
- endpoint path
- environment
- time range

## Step 3: Search and sort

1. Search by endpoint path
2. Click a column header to sort ascending/descending
3. Use pagination for large datasets

## Step 4: Inspect request-level details

Open **Logs** to inspect individual calls:

- method and path
- status code
- latency
- consumer identifier (if sent by SDK)
- request payload and response payload (if enabled)

## Step 5: Decide next action

Typical actions after finding an issue:

1. High 5xx rate: check upstream dependency and server logs
2. High latency: inspect heavy endpoints and DB queries
3. Large payloads: optimize response fields or compression
