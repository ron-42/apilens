# Troubleshooting

## No endpoint data visible

1. Confirm your app is sending traffic after SDK setup
2. Check API key is valid and belongs to the same app
3. Verify selected time range is not too narrow
4. Verify active filters are not excluding all rows
5. Check environment filter matches your SDK environment

## Magic link not received

1. Check spam/junk and corporate mail rules
2. Request a new link and use the latest one only
3. Confirm sender is allowed in your organization

## Magic link opens but login fails

1. Ensure link opens on `https://app.apilens.ai`
2. Avoid reusing old links (one-time tokens)
3. Clear browser session and retry

## Filters look empty

Filter options are data-driven.  
If no requests exist for a field in selected time range, options may be empty.

## Still blocked

Contact support with:

- app slug
- approximate timestamp
- endpoint path and method
- screenshot of the issue state
